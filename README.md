A fun project to retrieve large amounts of data from the results forms on GITAM's online results [website](https://doeresults.gitam.edu/onlineresults/pages/Newgrdcrdinput1.aspx).

Implemented with [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium) (Python 3) in Python, this repository contains code that helps in automating web browsers to retrieve student examination results. This data can be further used, for analytical purposes to monitor student/section performance.
